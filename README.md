# News App

## Overview
The News App is a web application that allows users to fetch and display the latest news articles from the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/). Users can search for specific topics and view a list of relevant articles in a clean, responsive interface.

## Features
- **Real-time News Fetching:** Displays the latest headlines from the TechCrunch news source by default.
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for news articles on specific topics by entering keywords into the search bar.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive, ensuring optimal viewing on devices of all sizes.
- **Interactive Blog Cards:** Each news article is displayed as a clickable card, showing a thumbnail image, title, and a truncated description. Clicking on a card opens the full article in a new tab.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5 & CSS3:** For structuring and styling the application.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Handles API requests, data processing, and dynamic DOM manipulation.
- **NewsAPI:** Integrated to fetch the latest news articles.

## How to Run
To view the project, simply open the `index.html` file in your browser. The app fetches news articles using the NewsAPI and displays them on the homepage. You can search for specific news topics using the search bar.

## Future Enhancements
- Add pagination to handle large sets of search results.
- Implement user authentication for personalized news feeds.
- Expand search functionality to include multiple sources and categories.
